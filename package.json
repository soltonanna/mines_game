  "description": "## Rule of game: 1. Start by choosing one of the three default board sizes, or by selecting a custom board; 2. The game begins with the board covered in tiles. Click on any tile to uncover it; 3. A colored number, which represent the number of mines in the adjacent tiles. This will help you deduce where the mines are so that you can mark them with flags; 4. A blank tile, which means there are no mines under any of the adjacent tile; 5. Repeat the previous step until you have uncovered all the tiles which do not have mines underneath them; 6. A mine, which will detonate and end the game.",
