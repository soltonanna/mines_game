## Pig Game 

## Rule of game:
1. Start by choosing one of the three default board sizes, or by selecting a custom board;
2. The game begins with the board covered in tiles. Click on any tile to uncover it;
3. A colored number, which represent the number of mines in the adjacent tiles. This will help you deduce where the mines are so that you can mark them with flags;
4. A blank tile, which means there are no mines under any of the adjacent tile;
5. Repeat the previous step until you have uncovered all the tiles which do not have mines underneath them;
6. A mine, which will detonate and end the game.
